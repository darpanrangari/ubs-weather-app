# UBS Weather App

The core functionality is added:

1. User can search for the location (using the geolocation API)
2. User can select location item from the suggested list of search results
3. User can view weather forecast for next 5 days for selected location (using the forecast API)
4. User can add selected location to the Favorites list
5. User can select location from the Favorites list

## Public Library used (only 1)
1. dayjs for date formating

## Features
1. User can search for any location 
2. If already added to favorites then button will be replaced with text
3. User can see 5 days of forecast data
4. Debounced input search
5. redux-toolkit used which automatically manages actions which also internally uses **Immer library** which handles immutability of state out of the box
6. weatherCode-image mapping used to give exact image of the weather in current time.

## Areas of improvement
1. The App still can be more broken down into components
2. Functional test can be added by using cypress
3. Can cache location data if already searched for it by using memo.
4. Local storage or database can be used to persist favorite location data

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
